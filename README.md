storage-info-polyfill
=====================

A small polyfill to simulate support for the [Quota Management API](https://developers.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/storage), which was introduced in Chrome 13. It doesn't really work, just pretends to, it is a work in progress to be frank. Still it maybe usefull to someone.

It was inspired by [Eric Bidelman's polyfill for the related File System APi](https://github.com/ebidel/idb.filesystem.js).
